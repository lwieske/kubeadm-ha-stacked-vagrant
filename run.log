    c01: Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!
    c01: 
    c01: To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:
    c01: 
    c01:   mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
    c01:   sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
    c01:   sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
    c01: 
    c01: Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:
    c01: 
    c01:   export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
    c01: 
    c01: You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
    c01: Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
    c01:   https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/
    c01: 
    c01: You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:
    c01: 
    c01:   kubeadm join 192.168.10.10:6443 --token abcdef.0123456789abcdef \
    c01: 	--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:6a8ed9c07b240b5250b892d5374d7d37d36ef51ae82094a3d7a0069e97cd9552 \
    c01: 	--control-plane --certificate-key 0e41d92dc3caae3f50837ae14c3a4441676633813ff32b0649a83caa6606ae9c
    c01: 
    c01: Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
    c01: As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
    c01: "kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.
    c01: 
    c01: Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:
    c01: 
    c01: kubeadm join 192.168.10.10:6443 --token abcdef.0123456789abcdef \
    c01: 	--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:6a8ed9c07b240b5250b892d5374d7d37d36ef51ae82094a3d7a0069e97cd9552

    c03: This node has joined the cluster and a new control plane instance was created:
    c03: 
    c03: * Certificate signing request was sent to apiserver and approval was received.
    c03: * The Kubelet was informed of the new secure connection details.
    c03: * Control plane (master) label and taint were applied to the new node.
    c03: * The Kubernetes control plane instances scaled up.
    c03: * A new etcd member was added to the local/stacked etcd cluster.
    c03: 
    c03: To start administering your cluster from this node, you need to run the following as a regular user:
    c03: 
    c03: 	mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
    c03: 	sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
    c03: 	sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
    c03: 
    c03: Run 'kubectl get nodes' to see this node join the cluster.
