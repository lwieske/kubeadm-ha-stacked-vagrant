    m01: Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!
    m01: 
    m01: To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:
    m01: 
    m01:   mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
    m01:   sudo cp -i 
    m01: /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
    m01:   sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
    m01: 
    m01: You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
    m01: Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
    m01:   https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/
    m01: 
    m01: You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:
    m01: 
    m01:   kubeadm join 10.10.10.10:6443 --token abcdef.0123456789abcdef \
    m01:     --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:962dd26b27773261a0892294299414fe5ffe8ce7be1123c127cf157f627344ee \
    m01:     --control-plane --certificate-key 78ffda19c17dd98e20938394abf9764e669f81aeaabc6886e12be3bf38d4ab10
    m01: 
    m01: Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
    m01: As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use 
    m01: "kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.
    m01: 
    m01: Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:
    m01: 
    m01: kubeadm join 10.10.10.10:6443 --token abcdef.0123456789abcdef \
    m01:     --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:962dd26b27773261a0892294299414fe5ffe8ce7be1123c127cf157f627344ee
